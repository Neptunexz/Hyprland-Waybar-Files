# Hyprland-Waybar-Files
Just the files I used for my waybar. 
Files are highly customizable, and the tutorial for adding/removing app icons is also included.


# How to install:
  * Download the file from this repository
  * Extract it into your ~/.config/ directory

# How to set it up:
  * Go into your main hyprland configuration file (most are at ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
  * Make sure your waybar is set to autostart, by adding this line:
      * exec-once = waybar
